# Exploits-eternalblu-netapi-modified-for-python3
I have found many github exploit sources, but the exploits of that sources were running with python2  
And there were some obstacles running the exploit.  
So I modified the eternalblue (ms17-010) and netapi (ms08-067) exploits to work with python3 (python 3.8)  
The exploit copyrights and sources are mentioned in the codes.
